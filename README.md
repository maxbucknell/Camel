# Camel

Hi, this is the RESTful API I'm writing to power my website, which will be some fancy front end thing. I'm experimenting with a lot of different things in this, and I'll explain a few of them.

## A note about the code

I know it's ridiculous. I don't write JavaScript like this for work, but it's a combination of letting my hair down and introducing some whimsy, and seeing how the kids write JavaScript these days.

I don't think one should ever be tied to one way of doing something.

I'm trying to keep everything in one file, which I don't think should be too hard. But it might be, so we can't be sure.

## A note about dynamics

I'm experimenting with the idea of ephemeral content, here. The mechanism I've got outlined at the moment is to give every item a score, and if that score gets to zero, it disappears. Certain things will decrease the score, like time, whereas other things might keep it alive. Readership, appreciation, the equivalent of Svbtle's kudos thing, I don't know. Possibly even occasional reanimation.

I guess I'd like to have some kind of syndicate thing going on here, with real, compelling things rather than just crap I've written.

That's the dream, anyway.
